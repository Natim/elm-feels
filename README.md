## Motivation
I'm creating this app to study [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) and experience creating a service from scratch to actually pushing it into production. I also want to have a small example service to work on from time to time whenever I want to try new stuff. This could also include things such as practicing design or evaluating and improving the UX.

## Vision
Ideally, I would like this app to be a place where you check in a couple of times per day to record your mood and any related thoughts. It could then help you track your mood changes and help you analyze what causes changes in your mood. I would also like to include a "end of day"-type reflection where you summarize your day, and what you could do better tomorrow.

Ideally, I would like to look more into practical ways to improve one's mindset and mood, and apply them here. One example is this [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOrzmFUJtrs), which says that giving yourself compliments is an effective method to build self-esteem.

After the general outline of the app is complete, I'll be looking more into creating a suitable backend with authentication for it, before giving it a design over-haul and renaming it. :)

## Installation

To run this app, you need both Node.js and Elm installed.

```
elm package install
npm install -g create-elm-app
npm install
npm run api # Runs the API server
npm run start # Starts the Elm app
```
